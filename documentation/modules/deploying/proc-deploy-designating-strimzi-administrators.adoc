= Designating {ProductName} administrators

{ProductName} provides custom resources for configuration of your deployment.
By default, permission to create, edit, and delete these resources is limited to Kubernetes cluster administrators.

The following procedure shows how to assign a `strimzi-admin` role that allows non-cluster administrators to manage {ProductName} resources.

A system administrator can designate {ProductName} administrators after the Cluster Operator is deployed.

.Prerequisites

* The {ProductName} Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and role-based access control (RBAC) resources to manage the CRDs have been xref:cluster-operator-{context}[deployed with the Cluster Operator].

.Procedure

. Create the `strimzi-admin` cluster role in Kubernetes.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f install/strimzi-admin

. Assign the `strimzi-admin` `ClusterRole` to one or more existing users in the Kubernetes cluster.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl create clusterrolebinding strimzi-admin --clusterrole=strimzi-admin --user=_user1_ --user=_user2_
